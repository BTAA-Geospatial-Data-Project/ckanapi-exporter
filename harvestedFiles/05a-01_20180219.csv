These feature classes support MNNR's SNA Work Planning application.<br/><br/>scientific_and_natural_area_boundaries: A polygon feature class delineated on and digitized from 1:24,000 U.S.G.S. quad maps of Minnesota Scientific and Natural Areas (SNAs).<br/><br/>Scientific and natural areas are established to protect and perpetuate in an undisturbed natural state those lands and waters embracing natural features of exceptional scientific and educational value. The SNA Program's goal is to ensure that no single rare feature is lost from any region of the state. This requires protection and management of each feature in sufficient quantity and distribution across the landscape. The Programs' Long Range Plan is to protect at least five locations of plant communities known to occur in each landscape region, and three locations per region of each rare species, plant or animal, and geologic feature. It is estimated that 500 natural areas are needed throughout the state to adequately protect significant features. Because over 40 percent of these rare features occur in prairies, 200 SNAs would be in the prairie area of the state. Of the remainder, approximately 135 are estimated to be needed in the deciduous and 165 in coniferous forest landscape communities in the next 100 years. Protection of multiple sites in each landscape region is a vital means of capturing the genetic diversity and preventing the loss of important species, communities, and features. This strategy observes the wisdom of not putting all our eggs in one basket. <br/><br/>In addition to SNA, Itasca and Crow Wing Counties have established county natural areas.

dd16ea6b-efa0-4e18-9490-c9d633c6d67f,2018-02-16T11:03:07.067549,Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),Natural Resources Department,"FEMA Digital Flood Rate Insurance Maps (DFIRM), Minnesota",water-dnr-fema-dfirm,"The Federal Emergency Managment Agency and the MNDNR produce Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRM) for selected counties in the state.  These maps are often referred to as FEMA Floodplain maps.<br/><br/>A DFIRM is the offical digital map of a community on which FEMA has delineated the special flood hazard areas, i.e., the floodplain areas where flood insurance is required for loans and where communities will administer floodplain regulations. (Note: Communities may regulate additional flood prone areas that are not on the FIRM).<br/><br/>Here are some of the feature classes included in the MNDNR's publication of the DFIRM Dataset:<br/><br/><b>FEMA DFIRM Base Flood Elevations</b><br/>The Base Flood Elevation (BFE) table is required for any digital data where BFE lines will be shown on the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Normally, if there are any riverine AE zones, BFE lines are required. The BFE table contains information about the BFEs within a study area. A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. BFE lines indicate the rounded whole-foot water-surface elevation of the 1-percent-annual-chance flood. The spatial elements representing BFE features are lines extending from Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) boundary to SFHA boundary. The BFE lines will have no visible gaps or overshoots between the SFHA boundary and the end of the BFE line at the publication scale of the DFIRM. However, the ends of the BFE lines are not necessarily snapped precisely to the SFHA boundary. Each BFE is represented by a single line. While BFE lines are depicted as wavy lines on the hardcopy FIRM, they should be primarily straight lines in the spatial data, although they may bend consistent with procedures described in Volume 1 of these Guidelines.<br/><br/><b>FEMA DFIRM Flood Hazard Zones</b><br/>FEMA flood hazard delineations are used by FEMA to designate the SFHA and for insurance rating purposes. These data are the flood hazard areas that are or will be depicted on the FIRM.<br/> <br/><b>FEMA DFIRM Panel Scheme Polygons</b><br/>This layer contains information about the FIRM panel areas. The spatial entities representing FIRM panels are polygons. The polygon for the FIRM panel corresponds to the panel neatlines. As a result, the panels are generally rectangular. In situations where a portion of a panel lies outside of the jurisdiction being mapped, the user must refer to the S_POL_AR table to determine the portion of the panel area where the DFIRM database shows the effective flood hazard data for the mapped jurisdiction.<br/><br/><b>FEMA DFIRM Cross Sections</b><br/>FEMA Cross Sections are required for any Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map database where cross sections are shown on the FIRM. Normally any FIRM that has associated flood profiles has cross sections. The corresponding attribute table contains information about cross section lines. A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. These lines represent the locations of channel surveys performed for input into the hydraulic model used to calculate flood elevations. These locations are also shown on the Flood Profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report and can be used to cross reference the Flood Profiles to the planimetric depiction of the flood hazards. All cross sections for which a spatial location is available should be included in this table. The spatial elements representing cross sections are lines generally extending from outside the floodplain, across the entire floodplain and out the other side. Each cross section should be represented by a single line feature without the hexagons shown on each end on the hardcopy map. The location and shape of the lines should depict as accurately as possible the position of the cross section used. This is a modified Standard DFIRM Database table that includes Standard DFIRM Database items and Enhanced Database items. All items after SOURCE_CIT are Enhanced. The Enhanced DFIRM Database must contain all modeled cross sections, whether they are printed on the FIRM or not.<br/><br/>Extensive information regarding the source data can be found in these two documents:<br/><a href=""ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/metadata/FEMA DFIRM Doc Appendix L Part A.pdf"">FEMA DFIRM Doc Appendix L Part A.pdf</a><br/><a href=""ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/metadata/FEMA DFIRM Doc Appendix L Part B.pdf"">FEMA DFIRM Doc Appendix L Part B.pdf</a>",Inland Waters,2/15/18,2014-06-25T21:29:12.317475,"{""type"":""Polygon"",""coordinates"":[[[-97.23, 43.5],[-97.23, 49.37], [-89.53, 49.37], [-89.53, 43.5], [-97.23, 43.5]]]}","JPEG, SHP, fgdb, gpkg, HTML",ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/metadata/metadata.html,"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/preview/preview.jpg, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/shp_water_dnr_fema_dfirm.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/fgdb_water_dnr_fema_dfirm.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/gpkg_water_dnr_fema_dfirm.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/metadata/metadata.html"

When there is no match to the PLS forty or government lot in the PLS40 layer, a record is then matched to the PLS section layer. These layers merge the DNR Control Point Generated PLS layer (PLS40) with land records stored in the DNR's Land Record System (LRS) in Oracle.  The data are limited to a forty, government lot, or section level representation.  Therefore, any state owned lands that are less than a forty, government lot, or section, are represented by the entire forty, government lot, or section. <br/>There are many different ways to look at these State lands.  In this case, layers have been created and grouped by selecting the type of State land, the type of interest held by the State, or the administrator of the State land, as follows:<br/>- one set of layers (i.e., stateland_type_xxx, where xxx represents the various categories) is created by selecting for the various land types stored in the LANDTYPE field. This set of layers only considers Fee Surface interests.<br/>- a second set of layers (i.e., stateland_interest_xxx, where xxx represents the various types of surface interests)  is created by selecting for the various interest types stored in the INT_TYPE field.  Note:  the stateland_interest_conservationeasement layer is a subset of the stateland_interest_easementin layer, so conservation easement records are also in the stateland_interest_easementin layer.<br/>- a third set of layers (i.e., stateland_admin_xxx, where xxx represents the various MNDNR units or a county administers these surface interests)  is created by selecting for the various administrators stored in the ADMINISTRATOR or ADMPRGPRJADDL fields.

Karst lands in Minnesota are developed in Paleozoic carbonate and sandstone bedrock. A significant sandstone karst has developed in Pine County (Shade and others, 2001). Most surficial karst features such as sinkholes are found only in those areas with less than fifty feet of sedimentary cover over bedrock surface (Gao and others, 2002).<br/><br/>Since the early 1980s, the Minnesota Geological Survey and Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota have been mapping karst features and publishing various versions of their results in the form of 1:100,000 scale County Geologic Atlases. In the mid 1990s, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources was assigned responsibility for the hydrogeology portions of the County Atlases and is now responsible for the karst mapping. Dalgleish and Alexander (1984), Alexander and Maki (1988), Witthuhn and Alexander (1995), Green and others (1997), Shade and others (2001), and Tipping and others (2001) published sinkhole distribution maps for Winona, Olmsted, Fillmore Counties, Leroy Township, Pine and Wabasha Counties respectively. Published atlases of Washington, Dakota, and the counties of the Twin Cites Metro area contain limited information on sinkhole occurrences.<br/><br/>A karst feature database of Southeastern Minnesota has been developed that allows sinkhole and other karst feature distributions to be displayed and analyzed across existing county boundaries in a GIS environment. The central DBMS is a relational GIS-based system interacting with three modules: spatial operation, spatial analysis, and hydrogeological modules. Data tables are stored in a Microsoft ACCESS 2000 DBMS and linked to corresponding ArcMap shapefiles. The current Karst Feature Database of Southeastern Minnesota was put on a Citrix Window 2000 server accessible to researchers and planners through networked interfaces.<br/><br/>The karst inventory points were point features such as sinkholes, springs, and stream sinks extracted from the karst feature database of Southeastern Minnesota.

Both codes will be kept in this database, but the GNIS_CODE is considered the official unique identifier from this point forward.  The GNIS codes are also slated to become official ANSI codes for these geographic features.

While the Council does not have official 2040 and 2050 water use forecasts for each community in the metropolitan area, population for these years was projected based on the amount of remaining developable land and predicted population growth trends between 2000 and 2030. 2040 and 2050 water use was forecast using the same rate of water use for 2030 multiplied by the forecasted population for 2040 and 2050. <br/><br/>More information can be found in Appendix E of the Metropolitan Council's 2009 report: Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Regional Groundwater Flow Model Version 2.00, Technical Report in Support of the Metropolitan Area Master Water Supply Plan.

From 1999 to 2003 land cover boundaries were created by interpreting, delineating, and digitizing vegetation communities and impervious surfaces. The Minnesota Land Cover Classification System (MLCCS)was used to interpret land cover types. MN DNR color infrared photography, Dakota County digital color aerial photography, and Pictometry were used for interpreting vegetation along with the following GIS data sets: national wetland inventory, county biological survey, hydric soils, physical water features, fieldline boundaries, woodline boundaries, and contours. Land cover boundaries were delineated on 1997 Metropolitan Council Digital Ortho Quarter Quads (DOQQ'S) from 1999 to 2000 (1991 United States Geological Survey DOQQ's were used for high water areas that were flooded on the 1997 DOQQ's), on 2000 Metropolitan Council DOQQ's from 2000 to 2002 and on 2002 Dakota County DOQQ's during 2003. Resulting interpreted and delineated land cover polygons were field checked where visible or accessible from roads or public property. Polygon boundaries were then digitized in ArcInfo at a 1:3,000 scale. A Minimum mapping unit of 1 acre was observed for both built-up and semi-natural and natural polygons. Exceptions: feedlots, prairies, stormwater ponds, and many wetlands were mapped at smaller sizes, and a portion of the City of Eagan extending from the southern municipal boundary northwest to 35E and east to Dodd Road to the north and Highway 3 to the south was re-mapped at a 1/4 acre mmu (only MLCCS 10,000 level codes). Partial updates were completed for: many wetland basins within the Vermillion River Watershed (political boundary) in 2006-07 during the WWIA using 2005 and 2006 aerial photography, many wetland basins within the North Cannon River Watershed (poltical boundary) in 2007-08 during the WWIA using 2006 and 2008 aerial photography, the entire Vermillion River Watershed (political boundary) in 2009 using 2008 and 2009 aerial photography, a 1 mile buffer area of both sides of all waterways within the North Cannon River Watershed (political boundary) in 2010 using 2009 aerial photography, all remaining sections of the North Cannon River Watershed (political boundary) in early 2012 using 2011 aerial photography, many areas of Dakota County north of Apple Valley/Rosemount during 2012 using 2011 aerial photography while spot checking data, all Dakota County FNAP property easements through 2013, and all BWSR approved Wetland Banks in Dakota County through 2013.

Minnesota has 46 watershed districts, most of which are named after the primary lake or river within the watershed. Minnesota's watershed districts do not cover the entire state. They are created through a local petition process. Minnesota Statute Chapter 103D governs the formation and operation of watershed districts. <br/><br/>In 1982, the Minnesota Legislature approved the Metropolitan Area Surface Water Management Act (Minnesota Statutes 103B.201 to 255), which requires local units of government in the seven-county Metro Area to prepare and implement comprehensive surface water management plans through membership in a watershed management organization (WMO).A watershed management organization (WMO) is defined as a watershed district wholly within the seven-county, Twin Cities Metropolitan Area or a joint powers entity established wholly or partly in the metropolitan area by special law or agreement to perform some or all of the functions of a watershed district. <br/><br/>NOTES: <br/>- MANY BOUNDARY DISCREPANCIES EXIST WITH THIS DATA SET.

Additional detail about these policies, including their application, are available in the Density & Activity Near Transit Fact Sheet  in the Local Planning Handbook.<br/><br/>The geographic file indicates where density requirements apply related to transit.  They include station areas along existing transitways, transitways under construction, and transitways where the locations of future stations have been finalized. It also applies to stations along Arterial BRT and along local bus routes that are part of Metro Transit's High Frequency Network. Density policy varies based on the type of transit and/or Community Designations in Thrive MSP 2040.<br/><br/>The relational data table includes accompanying information on Activity Levels for locations where this policy applies. Activity refers to land uses that can generate trips on transit. The TPP includes a guideline for minimum activity of a combined 7,000 total residents, jobs, and/or students. This Activity Level guideline does not apply to Arterial BRT or local bus routes that are part of the High Frequency Network. The table relates to the geographic file with the UNIQUE_ID field (Station name + Community Name). For stations that exist within more than one community, the table has an addition record with the station total. <br/><br/>Transit spatial features are the unique combination of transit station areas and municipalities. These features are defined based on the proximity to transit stations or to local bus routes on the High Frequency Network. In the case of Fixed/Dedicated Transitways and Highway Bus Rapid Transit, the proximity is based on half-mile radius from a centroid of the stations platform locations. In the case of Arterial Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), the proximity is quarter-mile radius from each bus stop centroid. Centroids are based on existing infrastructure locations or the approximate location of future transit stations. In the case of local bus routes on the High Frequency Network, the distance is quarter-mile on either side of the route.<br/><br/>Transit spatial features are transformed in three ways. Overlapping features are divided so that the data set only includes mutually exclusive features with geographic areas attributed to one station or another. However, if features with different density policies overlap, the feature with the higher density requirement supersedes the other. Features are also divided where they cross municipal boundaries.

The dataset does not depict the precise location of current urban services (Sewer service). In other words, the Urban Service Areas designate areas that might be serviced, it does not represent the urban areas that are serviced. The depiction of Urban Service Areas provides a framework in which known urban development and anticipated future development can exist with adequate sewer capacity at efficient service levels. Six other datasets are derived from these data: MUSA_2020, MUSA_2020_Outline, MUSA_2030, MUSA_2030_Outline, MUSA_2040, MUSA_2040_Outline, MUSA_Undesignated (Previously known as Flexible or Floating MUSA), MUSA Undesignated_Reserve (see below). NOTE: As of August 2012, The derived dataset MUSA_2010 is obsolete and no longer generate. However, the data details are still maintained in the MUSA_Composite dataset.<br/><br/>Each community (city or township) in the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area is required to complete a comprehensive plan for approval by the Metropolitan Council per the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 (Minn. Stat 473.864, Subd 2 and 473.175, Subd 1). The comprehensive plan must include a depiction of current and future boundaries of the Urban Service Areas (i.e., 2020, 2030, 2040, Post-2040). <br/><br/>The Metropolitan Urban Service Areas (MUSA) shown are compiled from each community's comprehensive plan. It may or may not include amendments to the comprehensive plan. Also, this map shows areas of 'Undesignated MUSA' found in some communities. Generally, Undesignated MUSA represents an areas where an agreed upon acreage of urban sewer service can be added to the current MUSA by 2030. Area added to the current MUSA is to be reported to the Metropolitan Council on an annual basis. As community's complete their 2018 Comprehensive Plans, Undesignated MUSA can represent areas to be added to the current MUSA by 2040.<br/><br/>As of March 2011, a new designation area was created specifically to address the agreed upon development plan for southeastern Scott County between the county, the city of Elko New Market and the town of New Market : 'Undesignated MUSA Reserve.' Similar to 'Undesignated MUSA,' this is an area where an agreed upon acreage of urban sewer service can be added to the current MUSA by 2030 and as community's complete their 2018 Comprehensive Plans, Undesignated MUSA can represent areas to be added to the current MUSA by 2040. The distinction between 'Undesignated MUSA' and 'Undesignated MUSA Reserve' is that 'Undesignated MUSA' is an area within a municipal boundary defined by that municipality's comprehensive plan, whereas, 'Undesignated MUSA Reserve' is an area beyond the current municipal boundary (i.e., surrounding township) that is designated in a joint agreement by the city, town, and county to accommodate future municipal growth. Urban sewer services will not be provided to these areas until they have been annexed by the municipality (i.e., Elko New Market). <br/><br/>Although the Metropolitan Council provides the majority of the urban sewer service in the seven-county metropolitan area, several smaller, free-standing rural communities in the region (primarily in Carver and Scott Counties), private systems, and independent nations (Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community) provide their own urban services. Where information on their urban service areas are available, it is included in this dataset. <br/><br/>Although the information included in this dataset is derived from the communities' 1998 and 2008 comprehensive plans, subsequent plan amendments, annual reporting of MUSA additions from Undesignated MUSA, and is intended to be current within 4 months, for exact MUSA information, please contact the community. <br/><br/>When referring to CURRENT MUSA extent, this includes areas up to 2020 MUSA. <br/><br/>These data were previously incorporated in the Comprehensive Plan Composite dataset",Planning + Cadastre,11/17/17,2015-09-05T10:01:52.655411,"{""type"":""Polygon"",""coordinates"":[[[-94.012, 44.471],[-94.012, 45.415], [-92.732, 45.415], [-92.732, 44.471], [-94.012, 44.471]]]}","JPEG, SHP, fgdb, gpkg, ags_mapserver, HTML",ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_musa_composite/metadata/metadata.html,"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_musa_composite/metadata/preview.jpg, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_musa_composite/shp_plan_musa_composite.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_musa_composite/fgdb_plan_musa_composite.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_musa_composite/gpkg_plan_musa_composite.zip, http://gis2.metc.state.mn.us/arcgis/rest/services/MetroGIS/Planning_Development/MapServer, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_musa_composite/metadata/metadata.html"

A principal goal of the Regional Planned Land Use dataset is to allow users to view, analyze and display planned land use data for anywhere in the seven county metropolitan area with a consistent land use classification scheme. The Metropolitan Council uses the Regional Planned Land Use (PLU) data to help monitor growth and plan for regional services such as regional parks, transit service, and wastewater collection and treatment. <br/><br/>Although the planned land use data is based on the locally adopted land use plans and designations for each community, it represent only data that has been submitted to the Metropolitan Council for review per the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 (Minn. Stat 473.864, Subd 2 and 473.175, Subd 1). See Data Quality Information (Section 2 of this metadata) for specifics about the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 under Completeness information. <br/><br/>Since there is no official State or Regional land use coding scheme that communities must conform with, the variability of content and codes between communities' land use plans is nearly as vast as the number of communities themselves (187). Differences among communities can range from the implementation of different land use categories to conflicting definitions of similar categories. The PLU dataset attempts to effectively level out the variability among communities by translating communities land use categories and descriptions into a common classification scheme developed and endorsed by MetroGIS (a regional GIS data sharing consortium) participants while retaining each communities' original categories. Although the comparability of land use plans between communities has greatly improved as a result of this translation or ""regionalization"" of communities' land use codes, it is possible that not all community land use definitions have been precisely translated into the most appropriate regional land use category. <br/><br/>In conjunction with other regional information (i.e., land use trend data, households and jobs forecasts), the PLU data can help communities more easily understand regional and sub-regional planning goals and Council staff, working with individual local units of government, can better plan for the future needs and financing of regional services. <br/><br/>- Contact individual communities for more information on their locally adopted planned land use categories. <br/><br/>- See Data Quality Information (Section 2 of this metadata) for specifics about the development of the regional dataset and its accuracy. <br/><br/>- See Entities and Attributes Information (Section 5 of this metadata) for specifics about the regional land use codes and categories.",Planning + Cadastre,11/17/17,2015-08-28T10:01:46.941857,"{""type"":""Polygon"",""coordinates"":[[[-94.012, 44.471],[-94.012, 45.415], [-92.732, 45.415], [-92.732, 44.471], [-94.012, 44.471]]]}","JPEG, fgdb, SHP, ags_mapserver, HTML",ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_pland_land_use/metadata/metadata.html,"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_pland_land_use/metadata/preview.jpg, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_pland_land_use/fgdb_plan_pland_land_use.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_pland_land_use/shp_plan_pland_land_use.zip, http://gis2.metc.state.mn.us/arcgis/rest/services/MetroGIS/Planning_Development/MapServer, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_pland_land_use/metadata/metadata.html"

In essence, this map shows how hot the ground was to the touch at any given location. This satellite image was taken at 11:59 am CDT on July 22, 2016. At this time, the air temperature was 90F with a heat index of 90.3F, as taken at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport, 2016). This was the third day of a regional heat wave , and while temperatures overnight had dipped down to around 74F, temperatures had climbed up to a maximum temperature of 97F  by around 5-6pm, resulting in the hottest day in roughly three years (Midwestern Regional Climate Center, 2016). The original thermal image was taken at a 100 x 100 meter resolution, but was re-scaled and processed at the 30 x 30 meter scale. (Landsat 8 collects image data at a spatial resolution of 30 meters (visible, NIR, SWIR); 100 meters (thermal); and 15 meters (panchromatic).)<br/><br/>This Landsat 8 raster image was first used to create a NDVI raster dataset. Using that NDVI dataset with Bands 10 and 11 of the Landsat 8 raster dataset, a Land Surface Temperature raster can be derived. That raster is further processed from celsius to fahrenheit, then clipped to the 7-county metropolitan area, and all water bodies removed from the final image. <br/><br/>The LST values without regional water bodies is the primary basis for the Metropolitan Council Climate Vulnerability Assessment Report. Part of this report specifically considers the urban heat island effect, or the effect of human activity and the built environment on increases in urban temperature on human life, and as water has different heat retention properties than most land surfaces, we chose to do our analysis without regional water bodies. It should be noted that the lowest original LST values were water bodies, and so by removing the water bodies from the map the minimum LST value raised 0.6F. This is not particularly significant, except that it would minimally affect which values would be highlighted in the third layer of this package.

Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating higher biotic integrity.  Attributes correspond to the <U>most recent IBI survey</u> for each lake.<br/><br/>An <i>IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity)</i> is a biologically-based, multi-metric method for measuring the integrity of aquatic systems.  Minnesota DNR Fisheries Research has developed a fish-based lake IBI that incorporates fish data collected by various methods (trap nets, gill nets, shoreline seines, and backpack electrofishing units) into 8-15 metrics in three categories:  <b>species richness, community assemblage, and trophic composition </b> <i>(see Section 5: Attributes)</i>.  Each metric represents an aspect of the biological assemblage structure, function, or other measurable characteristic that changes in some predictable way with increased human-induced stress. Fish IBI scores respond to differences in land use patterns, trophic state, and aquatic vegetation.<br/><br/>Validation studies indicate that the fish-based lake IBI scores function as a measure of fish community response to human disturbance across a gradient of lakes.  Continuing work by DNR Fisheries will expand the application of this IBI to more lake types and will validate this tool as a viable method for assessing lake impairment as part of Minnesota's 303(d) <i>Impaired Waters</i> assessments.

The buffer map data comprise two geographical feature classes: one linear feature class for watercourses and one polygonal feature class for lakes, reservoirs and wetlands. The attribute for the buffer width requirement is derived from three different classification attributes: (1) the Minnesota DNR's Public Waters Inventory classification, (2) the DNR assigned shoreland classification, and (3) public open drainage system data (also referred to as open ditches) established under Minnesota Statute (M.S.) 103E and provided by local drainage authorities.

Public water wetlands without DNR shoreland classifications are excluded from the buffer map. The DNR coordinated with counties and watershed districts to identify public ditches that require a buffer.<br/><br/>The buffer protection map helps landowners identify buffer protection requirements, under Minnesota's Buffer Law. Public ditches require a 16.5-foot buffer and public waters require a 50-foot average buffer; public ditches that are also public watercourses require a 16.5-foot buffer unless the DNR assigned a specific shoreland classification, in which case a 50-foot average buffer is required. Local ordinances may require wider buffers. This map displays minimum standards and is not intended to affect existing local controls that are more restrictive than these requirements.

The dataset was developed by the Metropolitan Council, a regional governmental organization that deals, in part, with regional issues and long range planning for the Twin Cities area. The data were interpreted from 1984, 1990, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2016 air photos and other source data, with additional assistance from county parcel data and assessor's information. <br/><br/>The Metropolitan Council has routinely developed generalized land use for the Twin Cities region since 1984 to support its statutory responsibilities and assist in long range planning for the Twin Cities area. The Council uses land use information to monitor growth and to evaluate changing trends in land consumption for various urban purposes. The Council uses the land use trend data in combination with its forecasts of households and jobs to plan for the future needs and financing of Metropolitan services (i.e. Transit, Wastewater Services, etc.). Also, in concert with individual local units of government, the land use and forecast data are used to evaluate expansions of the metropolitan urban service area (MUSA). <br/><br/>The Council does not specifically survey the rights-of-way of minor highways, local streets, parking lots, railroads, or other utility easements. The area occupied by these uses is included with the adjacent land uses, whose boundaries are extended to the centerline of the adjacent rights-of way or easements. The accuracy of Council land use survey data is suitable for regional planning purposes, but should not be used for detailed area planning, nor for engineering work. <br/><br/>Until 1997, the Metropolitan Council had manually interpreted aerial photos on mylar tracing paper into a 13-category land-use classification system to aggregate and depict changing land use data. In 1997, with technological advances in GIS and improved data, the Metropolitan Council was able to delineate land uses from digital aerial photography with counties' parcel and assessor data and captured information with straight 'heads-up' digitizing with GIS software. Also, understanding that land use data collected and maintained at the county and city level are collected at different resolutions using different classification schemes, the Metropolitan Council worked with local communities and organizations to develop a cooperative solution to integrate the Council's land use interpretation with a generally agreed upon regional classification system. By 2000, the Metropolitan Council had not only expanded their Generalized Land Use Classification system to include 22 categories, but had refined how they categorized land (removing all ownership categories) to reflect actual use. See the Entities and Atributes section of the metadata for a detailed description of each of the land use categories and available subcategories. <br/><br/>With the completion of the 2016 Generalized Land Use dataset, regional and local planners have the ability to map changes in urban growth and development in a geographic information system (GIS) database. By tracking land use changes, the Metropolitan Council and local planners can better visualize development trends and anticipate future growth needs. <br/><br/><br/>NOTE ABOUT COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: <br/><br/>It is important to understand the changes between land use inventory years and how to compare recent land use data to historical data. <br/><br/>In general, over the land use years, more detailed land use information has been captured. Understanding these changes can help interpret land use changes and trends in land consumption. For detailed category definitions, specific land use comparisons and how best to compare the land uses between 1984 and 2016, please refer to the Attribute Accuracy or the Data Quality section of the metadata. <br/><br/>It is also important to note that changes in data collection methodology also effects the ability to compare land use years: <br/><br/>- In 2000, the land use categories were modified to more accurately reflect the use of the land rather than ownership. Although this has minimal effect on associating categories between 1997 and 2000, is may have had an affect on some particular land use. For example, land owned by a community or county but had no apparent active use could have been classified as 'Public/ Semi-Public' prior to 2000. In 2000, land with no apparent use, regardless of who owns it, is classified as 'Undeveloped.' <br/><br/>- With better resolution of air photos beginning in 2000, the incorporation of property information from county assessors and the use of more accurate political boundaries (particularly on the exterior boundaries of the region), positive impacts were made on the accuracy of new land use delineations between pre-2000 land use data and data collected in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2016. With the improved data, beginning in 2000, a greater effort to align land use designations, both new and old, to correspond with property boundaries (county parcels) where appropriate. In addition, individual properties were reviewed to assess the extent of development. In most cases, if properties under 5 acres were assessed to be at least 75% developed, then the entire property was classified as a developed land use (not 'Undeveloped'). As a result of these realignments and development assessments, changes in land use between early land use years (1984-1997) and more recent years (2000-2016) will exist in the data that do NOT necessarily represent actual land use change. These occurrences can be found throughout the region. <br/><br/>There are also numerous known deficiencies in the datasets. Some known deficiencies are specific to a particular year while others may span the entire time series.

The NPS VIP is managed by the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Division and provides baseline vegetation information to the NPS Natural Resource I&M Program. The USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, NatureServe, and NPS Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MISS) have completed vegetation classification and mapping of MISS for the NPS VIP.<br/><br/>Mappers, ecologists, and botanists collaborated to identify and describe vegetation types within the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC) and to determine how best to map them by using aerial imagery. The team collected data from 132 vegetation plots within MISS to develop detailed descriptions of USNVC associations. Data from 52 verification sites were also collected to test both the dichotomous key to vegetation associations and the application of vegetation types to a sample set of map polygons. Furthermore, data from 776 accuracy assessment (AA) sites were collected (of which 757 were used to test accuracy of the vegetation map layer). These data sets led to the identification of 45 vegetation association in the USNVC at MISS.<br/><br/>A total of 45 map classes were developed to map the vegetation and open water of MISS, including the following: 35 map classes represent natural (including ruderal) vegetation in the USNVC, 7 map classes represent cultural vegetation (agricultural and developed) in the USNVC, and 3 map classes represent non-vegetative open-water bodies (non-USNVC). Features were interpreted from viewing color-infrared digital aerial imagery dated September and October 2012 (during peak leaf-phenology change of trees) via digital onscreen three-dimensional stereoscopic workflow systems in geographic information systems (GIS). The interpreted data were digitally and spatially referenced, thus making the spatial database layers usable in GIS. Polygon units were mapped to either a 0.5 ha or 0.25 ha minimum mapping unit, depending on vegetation type.<br/><br/>A geodatabase containing various feature-class layers and tables shows the locations of USNVC vegetation types (vegetation map), vegetation plot samples, verification sites, AA sites, project boundary extent, and aerial image centers. The feature-class layer and relate tables for the vegetation map provides 4,498 polygons of detailed attribute data covering 21,771.6 ha of area, with an average polygon size of 4.8 ha; the vegetation map covers the entire administrative boundary for MISS.<br/><br/>Summary reports generated from the vegetation map layer show map classes representing USNVC natural (including ruderal) vegetation associations apply to 4,012 polygons (89.2% of polygons) and cover 8,938.7 ha (41.1%) of the map extent. Of these polygons, the map layer shows MISS to be 27.5% forest and woodland (5,986.2 ha), 1.6% shrubland (353.6 ha), 11.2% herbaceous vegetation (2,431.8 ha), and 0.8% sparse vegetation (163.9 ha). Map classes representing USNVC cultural types apply to 415 polygons (9.2% of polygons) and cover 7,628.5 ha (35.0%) of the map extent.

Flow metrics were calculated for all stream segments, based on the NHDPlus V2 (National Hydrography Dataset). The flow metrics were calculated using regression equations fit to existing stream gaging data in the region, and include high flows, low flows, and indices of flashiness and base flow. The independent variables included catchment area, wetland and forest fraction within the catchment, and surficial geology types. Flow data were used from the period 1/1/82 to 12/31/14, so that the flow metrics represent typical values for this period. This data table includes the COMID number taken from the NHDPlus V2 hydrography, so that these data may be joined to NHDPlus stream segment or catchment shape files in a GIS framework for visual display. Each flow metric is assigned a quality rating. This rating was calculated based on 75% prediction intervals for each regression equation. Catchments with one or more predictor variables outside of the range of variables covered by the gaged catchments have a higher prediction interval range (more uncertainty), and are assigned a lower quality rating. For example, catchments that are much smaller than range of catchment size covered by the gaged catchments have more uncertainty in the value of each flow metric.

Data in the Biotics Database are maintained according to established Natural Heritage Methodology developed by NatureServe and The Nature Conservancy.  The core of the Biotics Database is made up of Element Occurrence (EO) records of rare plant and animal species, animal aggregations, native plant communities, and geologic features.  An Element is a unit of biological diversity, such as a species, subspecies, or a native plant community.  An EO is an area of land and/or water in which an Element is, or was, present, and which has practical conservation value for the Element (e.g. species or community) as evidenced by potential continued (or historical) presence and/or regular recurrence at a given location.  Source Features are the mapped representation of observations of rare features.

The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map. The map is scanned at a minimum resolution of 250 dots per inch.<br/><br/>DRG's are created by scanning published paper maps on high-resolution scanners.  The raster image is georeferenced and fit to the UTM projection.  Colors are standardized to remove scanner limitations and artifacts.

The update is being conducted in geographic phases with data released for each region as it is finalized. This metadata record covers the first three geographic regions: northeast, east-central, and southern Minnesota. Major funding was provided by the Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund. The updated NWI classify wetlands according to the system developed by Cowardin et al. (1979). The data also contains a simplified plant community classification (SPCC) and a simplified hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classification. Quality assurance of the data included visual inspection, automated checks for attribute validity and topologic consistency, as well as a formal accuracy assessment based on an independent field verified data set. Further details on the methods employed can be found in the technical procedures document for this project located on the project website (http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/eco/wetlands/nwi_proj.html ). The updated NWI data are primarily based on spring aerial imagery acquired in 2011 and LiDAR elevation data as well as other modern ancillary data. These data are intended to replace the original 1980s NWI data. NWI data support effective wetland management, protection, and restoration. The data provide a baseline for assessing the effectiveness of wetland policies and management actions. These data are used at all levels of government, as well as by private industry and non-profit organizations for wetland regulation and management, land use and conservation planning, environmental impact assessment, and natural resource inventories.<br/>   <br/>            EAST-CENTRAL: Operational support for wetland mapping and classification was provided by Ducks Unlimited (DU) and support for methods development and field validation were provided by the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota.

The east-central project area consists of 13 counties including: Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota, Goodhue, Hennepin, Isanti, Ramsey, Rice, Scott, Sherburne, Washington, and Wright Counties. The updated wetland inventory area included complete coverage for all USGS quarter quadrangles that intersect any of these counties (about 7,150 square mile).The NWI classification process for east-central Minnesota consisted of three basic steps: 1) creation of image segments (polygons), 2) RandomForest classification of the segments, and 3) photo-interpretation/editing of the classified image segments.<br/><br/>            NORTHEAST: Operational support for wetland mapping and classification was provided by Ducks Unlimited (DU) and support for methods development and field validation were provided by the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. The DNR Resource Assessment Office provided additional support data processing, field checking, and quality control review. The project area consists of 5 counties in northeast Minnesota including: Cook, Koochiching, Lake, St. Louis, and a portion of Carlton Counties. The project encompasses 1,097 USGS quarter quads covering an area of 14,330 square miles (17% of the state). The NWI classification process for northeast Minnesota consisted of three basic steps: 1) creation of image segments (polygons), 2) RandomForest classification of the segments, and 3) photo-interpretation of the classified image segments. Please note that a portion of Koochiching County was completed as a separate pilot project. Those data are not yet included in the greater northeast regional product and will be incorporated after their validation is complete.<br/>                 <br/>            SOUTHERN: Operational support for wetland mapping and classification was provided by Geospatial Services of St. Mary's University of Minnesota (SMUMN) and support for methods development and field validation were provided by the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. The MNDNR Resource Assessment Office provided additional support data processing, field checking, and quality control review.

The project encompasses 1,787 USGS quarter quads covering an area of 23,900 square miles (28% of the state). The NWI classification process for southern Minnesota relied on visual image interpretation and other geospatial techniques to identify and classify wetlands using remote sensing data. <br/><br/>            NOTE: The layer files for this data have been set up to restrict drawing of the data when zoomed out beyond 1:100,000 scale for the east-central region and when zoomed out beyond 1:250,000 scale for the northeast and southern regions. This is, in part, to prevent problems with slow performance with this large dataset. However, the data have also been compressed to speed the drawing performance and this results in a terminal system instability in ArcMap version 10.2 when the east-central data are viewed zoomed out beyond about 1:100,000 scale (1:60,000 scale for the Cowardin symbolized layer). This does not affect the more recent versions of ArcMap such as ArcMap 10.2.2.

Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle.  These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product.  With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release.  In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date.  To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release.

The classification results were evaluated for each area using independent stratified randomly generated points.

No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties.  A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county.  (See section 5 of the metadata).  The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers.  Not all attributes are populated for all counties.  Summary attribute  information is in the Attributes Overview.  Detailed information about the attributes can be found in the <a href=""ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metrogis/plan_regonal_parcels_2016/metadata/MetroGIS_Regional_Parcels_Attributes_2016.pdf"" target=_blank>MetroGIS Regional Parcels Attributes</a> document.<br/><br/>The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset.  Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not.  (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.)  The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset.  The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon.  One primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos.  Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units.  Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset.  The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated.  <br/><br/>The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files.  The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.<br/><br/>In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them.

The template is intended to help drainage authorities modernize and better manage their drainage system records. In addition, the template puts the data into a consistent, standardized form that makes is more readily accessible to users such as hydrologists and water managers.<br/>	<br/>However, as a result of a stipulation for receiving the grant, <i><b>BWSR requires that those drainage authorities that use the template make their hydrographic data (ditch/tile centerlines, drainage structures, profile points and watershed boundaries) available annually to the public via the Geospatial Commons.</b></i> The button below links to the Template Request Form that must be filled out and signed by the proper drainage authority personnel and then submitted to BWSR.

While many of the demands on the forests from these two industries are compatible and even complementary, concern about the specific impacts of various forest management practices on visual quality became the focus for a positive dialogue tourism and forest products industries.<br/> <br/>In the fall of 1990, representatives of the Minnesota Resort Association and the Minnesota Forest Industries began meeting to address the issue of visual quality. A Timber and Tourism Steering Committee was formed to enhance communication, promote understanding and continue to discuss common concerns. Under the leadership of the Steering Committee, public and private forestry interest came together and developed a set of visual quality guidelines.<br/> <br/><h3>Visual Sensitivity Classification</h3> The visual quality guidelines recognized the fact that not all travel routes have the same level of visual sensitivity. To implementation of the visual quality guidelines, classification of the visual sensitivity of highways, roads, designated recreation trails, lakes, and rivers in forested areas was required.<br/> <br/>County Visual Quality Committees were formed to classify travel routes within their counties. The county committees were made up of county residents that represented tourism and forest products industries and interests. Three factors were used in the classification process:<br/>- The perceived degree of sensitivity of users of a travel route or recreation area concerning landscape aesthetics.<br/>- The volume and type of use a travel route or recreation area receives.<br/>- The speed of travel within a route or area.<br/> <br/>The levels of visual sensitivity are:<br/><br/><strong>Most sensitive</strong> - Applies to travel routes and areas where significant public use occurs and where the visual quality is of high concern to typical users. Examples of such routes may include public highways, local roads, recreational lakes and rivers, and designated recreational trails and areas that provide a high level of scenic quality.<br/> <br/><strong>Moderately sensitive</strong> - Applies to travel routes or recreation areas, not included in Level 1, where visual quality is of moderate concern to typical users. Examples of these routes and areas may include public highways and local roads, recreational lakes and rivers, and designated recreational trails that provide moderate to high scenic quality but less significant public use.<br/> <br/><strong>Less sensitive</strong> - Applies to travel routes or recreation areas, not included in Levels 1 or 2, where visual quality is of less concern to typical users.

This rating system propagated racial segregation that in many ways persists today.<br/><br/>The FHA Underwriting Handbook incorporated color-coded real estate investment maps that classified neighborhoods based on assumptions about a community, primarily their racial and ethnic composition, and not on the financial ability of the residents to satisfy the obligations of a mortgage loan. These maps, created by the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) were used to determine where mortgages could or could not be issued. <br/><br/>The neighborhoods were categoriezed into four types:<br/>Type A : Best - newer or areas stil in demand<br/>Type B : Still Desirable - areas expected to remain stable for many years<br/>Type C : Definitely Declining - areas in transition<br/>Type D : Hazardous - older areas considered risky<br/><br/>Neighborhoods shaded red were deemed too hazardous for federally-back loans. These ""red-lined"" neighborhoods were where most African American residents lived. <br/><br/>Many have argued tha the HOLC maps institutionalized discriminating lending practices which not only perpetuated racial segregation but also led to neighborhood disinvestment.

The data was generated using Marxan - the most widely-used decision support software for the design of conservation reserve systems in the world. Marxan has the ability to take primary input information such as the location of rare species, biodiversity areas, or mapped extent of different native plant communities and weigh against other types of information such as conservation constraints against the primary input. It then maps a result that provides the most efficient layout of a conservation system that addresses the primary conservation targets. <br/><br/>Marxan operates by creating hypothetical mapping solutions to see how well the areas mapped in each solution provide the most efficient means of creating a conservation reserve system. As applied to this plan, the software creates 300 scenarios using 160-acre cells across each ECS subsection in the state. A cell size of 160 acres was selected since it provides a reasonable level of resolution for a state-level plan and stays within the capacity of the computers processing very large amounts of data. It conducts iterative sampling via 1,000,000 iterations per scenario to create the optimal grouping of cells that efficiently capture enough locations of conservation features to meet the target level of conservation for each designated type of feature within the study area.<br/><br/>A target was set for each native plant community type occurring within each subsection. An example would be a target value of capturing 75% of all calcareous fens within an ECS subsection. If a solution set does not meet this goal, it can be penalized, and Marxan will go through the remainder of the 1,000,000 iterations for that scenario trying to create a better solution that captures 75% of calcareous fens. The solution seeks to meet the conservation target and minimize the amount of land required to meet all of the other conservation targets (for other NPC types) also.<br/><br/>Other factors are also entered into Marxan such as the following:<br/>- Determining whether certain cells should be locked in or out, i.e. sometimes certain cells would always be included or excluded<br/>- Lands with high opportunity costs: Prime and Unique Farmland soils (likely to be already farmed or have a high likelihood of being converted to farmland), greater than 4% impervious surfaces in the Twin cities Metropolitan Area, and School Trust Fund lands.<br/>- The degree to which cells should be grouped together to create small, discrete sites versus landscape corridors<br/><br/>Marxan will try to avoid selecting cells that have high opportunity costs even if they contain rare conservation features, as this will drive up the total ""cost"" of the solution set. However, some conservation features are so rare that all locations must be selected regardless of cost. Either these features may be included at the expense of other less costly features, or their costs are so high that the selection will be very specific, resulting in virtually no areas peripheral to the conservation feature being selected that could function in a buffering or connecting capacity.<br/>One of the most useful functions of Marxan is its ability to sort through different layers of inputs and constraints to generate results at a desired level of aggregation. Marxan also has a ""clumping factor"" input that allows the project to generate results with highly segregated priority areas, or to find the optimal way to create landscape-level ""clumps"" of conservation areas. The latter approach was selected as an adaptation strategy set forth in climate change assessments.<br/><br/><b>Conservation Opportunity Areas</b><br/>Opportunity Areas are a way of further defining the Marxan high priority aggregations as discrete planning areas to focus for conservation efforts.   These areas are selected for their capacity to provide the following:<br/>- Significant rare resources, native communities, natural features, or biodiversity significance<br/>- Partners that are willing to plan, implement, and evaluate conservation actions	<br/>- Conservation that is motivated by an agreed-upon conservation purpose and set of objectives<br/>- Contributions to a conservation network that provides pathways for species mobility, which is particularly critical when addressing climate change concerns  <br/><br/>Opportunity Areas were only developed for the ECS subsections that had complete MBS data coverage.  These Opportunity Areas are detailed in Part 2 of the SNA Strategic Plan.<br/><br/>Initially, the boundaries of Conservation Opportunity Areas were drawn to capture the high and highest-priority areas (orange and red zones) from the Marxan output, and in many cases the moderate priority areas (yellow zones).  This provided a base area for each Opportunity Area.  Additional information layers were added to see how well the Marxan outputs protected rare or diverse conservation features, such as the National Land Cover Data set, the Element Occurrences of Natural Heritage rare features, Ecological Evaluations, and areas of biodiversity significance.  Land cover was used as a layer to look at connectivity within high priority areas.  This was particularly helpful in areas such as southeastern Minnesota, where strong landform patterns created by ridges and valleys can be used to provide connectivity.  Ridges and floodplains are frequently cultivated, but valley side slopes also form a network that provides native forest or goat prairies that provide better species connectivity than cropped lands.   Mapping workshops were held with a variety of DNR staff to refine the Opportunity Areas.  In most regions, some boundary adjustments were made to include conservation features.  Infrequently, an entirely new area was added and a few areas were removed.   <br/><br/>",Environment,,2016-05-06T10:03:07.012834,"{""type"":""Polygon"",""coordinates"":[[[-97.23, 43.5],[-97.23, 49.37], [-89.53, 49.37], [-89.53, 43.5], [-97.23, 43.5]]]}","fgdb, SHP, gpkg, HTML",ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_sna_conserv_opportunity_area/metadata/metadata.html,"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_sna_conserv_opportunity_area/fgdb_env_sna_conserv_opportunity_area.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_sna_conserv_opportunity_area/shp_env_sna_conserv_opportunity_area.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_sna_conserv_opportunity_area/gpkg_env_sna_conserv_opportunity_area.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_sna_conserv_opportunity_area/metadata/metadata.html"

The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map. The map is scanned at a minimum resolution of 250 dots per inch. DRG's are created by scanning published paper maps on high-resolution scanners. The raster image is georeferenced and fit to the UTM projection. Colors are standardized to remove scanner limitations and artifacts. The average data set size is about 6 megabytes in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) with PackBits compression. DRG's can be easily combined with other digital cartographic products such as digital elevation models (DEM) and digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ). DRG's are stored as rectified TIFF files in geoTIFF format. GeoTIFF is a relatively new TIFF image storage format that incorporates georeferencing information in the header. This allows software, such as ArcView, ARC/INFO, or EPPL7 to reference the image without an additional header or world file. Within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Core GIS data set the DRG's have been processed to be in compliance with departmental data standards (UTM Extended Zone 15, NAD83 datum) and the map collar information has been removed to facilitate the display of the DRG's in a seamless fashion. These DRG's were clipped and transformed to UTM Zone 15 using EPPL7 Raster GIS.<br/><br/>DRGs are a useful backdrop for mapping a variety of features. Colors representing various items in the image (contours, urban areas, vegetation, etc.) can be turned off or highlighted depending on the mapping application. In ArcView this is done by choosing the ""Colormap"" option when editing the DRG theme's legend. A variety of other ArcView tools exist to make working with DRGs easier.  <br/><br/>Also included:<br/>Metadata for the scanned USGS 24k Topograpic Map Series (also known as 24k Digital Raster Graphic).

The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system.  No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties.  A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county.  (See section 5 of the metadata).  The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers.  Not all attributes are populated for all counties.<br/><br/>The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset.  Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not.  (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.)  The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset.  The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon.  The primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos.  Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units.  Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset.  The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated.  <br/><br/>The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files.  The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.<br/><br/>In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them.

Blocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists.<br/><br/>Users are encouraged to refer to the U.S. Census website for more information on ZCTAs:  http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html <br/>and to the U.S. Postal Service for more information on ZIP Codes:  http://faq.usps.com/",Boundaries,,2015-03-17T08:01:51.234380,"{""type"":""Polygon"",""coordinates"":[[[-97.23, 43.5],[-97.23, 49.37], [-89.53, 49.37], [-89.53, 43.5], [-97.23, 43.5]]]}","JPEG, fgdb, SHP, HTML, gpkg",ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/bdry_zip_code_tabulation_areas/metadata/metadata.html,"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/bdry_zip_code_tabulation_areas/metadata/preview.jpg, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/bdry_zip_code_tabulation_areas/fgdb_bdry_zip_code_tabulation_areas.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/bdry_zip_code_tabulation_areas/shp_bdry_zip_code_tabulation_areas.zip, http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/bdry_zip_code_tabulation_areas/gpkg_bdry_zip_code_tabulation_areas.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/bdry_zip_code_tabulation_areas/metadata/metadata.html"

The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that represents the surface water of the United States using common features such as lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, canals, stream gages, and dams. Polygons are used to represent area features such as lakes, ponds, and rivers; lines are used to represent linear features such as streams and smaller rivers; and points are used to represent point features such as stream gages and dams. Lines also are used to show the water flow through area features such as the flow of water through a lake. The combination of lines is used to create a network of water and transported material flow to allow users of the data to trace movement in downstream and upstream directions. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Minnesota River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds.",Inland Waters,4/13/15,2014-09-08T17:37:41.977833,"{""type"":""Polygon"",""coordinates"":[[[-98.4, 41.7],[-98.4, 49.9], [-89.0, 49.9], [-89.0, 41.7], [-98.4, 41.7]]]}","JPEG, HTML, fgdb, SHP",ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/water_national_hydrography_data/metadata/metadata.html,"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/water_national_hydrography_data/metadata/preview.jpg, http://nhd.usgs.gov/, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/water_national_hydrography_data/fgdb_water_national_hydrography_data.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/water_national_hydrography_data/shp_water_national_hydrography_data.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/water_national_hydrography_data/metadata/metadata.html"

Plans are to also add Local Urban Service Area (LUSA) boundaries to this dataset.<br/><br/>A MUSA boundary line is the outer edge of the urban area.  It is a line agreed to jointly by the Council and local governments through local comprehensive plan reviews.  It delimits the outer reaches of regional services for the specified time period.  <br/><br/>A LUSA boundary line is the outer edge of the urban service are in rural growth centers.  Rural growth centers are incorporated areas that currently provide central sewer service and that have planned long-term expansions of their urban service area.  These small cities are expected to plan for a balance of housing and jobs to promote self-sufficiency.  This service area boundary, like the MUSA, is agreed to jointly by the Council and local governments through local comprehensive plan reviews.  It delimits the outer reaches of regional services for the specified time period.  <br/><br/>Many of the lines that define the MUSA boundary are municipal boundaries.  In this layer, these lines have been derived from the County and Minor Civil Divisions layer compiled by the Metropolitan Council.  Other lines in this layer have been derived from municipal comprehensive plan maps at a variety of scales and accuracy levels.<br/><br/>NOTES:  <br/>-  The lines in this layer are not expected to be as positionally accurate as parcel datasets available from most counties in the Twin Cities area.<br/>-  Significant errors have been noticed in the original 1995 dataset.  These include missing polygons and lines that differ significantly from the parcel boundaries that actually define the MUSA.  These errors will be fixed as they are encountered.  See Horizontal Positional Accuracy for more information.<br/>-  Additionally, areas included in the MUSA in any particular year can, at times, be difficult to determine from maps submitted to the Council prior to 1998, and do not necessarily match maps from previous years.<br/>-  Some communities have 'undesignated' or 'floating' MUSAs.

Those who implement and maintain approved farm management practices will be certified and in turn obtain regulatory certainty for a period of ten years. <br/><br/>The program is the product of a state-federal partnership that includes the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR), the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). <br/><br/>The Minnesota Agricultural Water Quality Certification Program was initially piloted in four distinct regions of the state; these areas represented a diversity of Minnesota's agricultural landscapes and cropping systems, differences in water resource concerns and also leverage the strength of existing local partnerships. The pilot areas include: Elm Creek in Cottonwood, Faribault, Jackson, Martin and Watonwan counties, the Middle Sauk River in Stearns County, Whiskey Creek in Otter Tail and Wilkin counties, and the Whitewater River in Olmsted, Wabasha and Winona counties. <br/><br/>In June and July 2015 the program was expanded first to several counties and then to the entire state of Minnesota. The MAWQCP was expanded across the state in coordination with Soil and Water Conservation Districts and our other partners. Interested producers can find their nearest certification provider by contacting MDA at 651-201-6489 or MDA.MAWQCP@state.mn.us. <br/><br/><br/>For further information and details about this program, visit http://www.mda.state.mn.us/awqcp.","Boundaries, Environment, Farming, Inland Waters",8/17/15,2015-08-18T10:01:42.567749,"{""type"":""Polygon"",""coordinates"":[[[-97.23, 43.5],[-97.23, 49.37], [-89.53, 49.37], [-89.53, 43.5], [-97.23, 43.5]]]}","JPEG, fgdb, SHP, gpkg, HTML",ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/agri_mawqcp_areas/metadata/metadata.html,"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/agri_mawqcp_areas/metadata/preview.jpg, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/agri_mawqcp_areas/fgdb_agri_mawqcp_areas.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/agri_mawqcp_areas/shp_agri_mawqcp_areas.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/agri_mawqcp_areas/gpkg_agri_mawqcp_areas.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/agri_mawqcp_areas/metadata/metadata.html"

The western part of the mapped Precambrian terrane is inferred largely from geophysical maps, anchored locally by drilling. In many places, contacts are drawn between units of the same or similar apparent rock type (and same unit label); these are recognized as geometrically distinct, though geophysically or lithologically similar.

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophotoquad (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75-minutes of latitude by 3.75-minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator Projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quad plus overedge. The overedge ranges a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The standard, archived digital orthophoto is formatted as four ASCII header records, followed by a series of 8-bit binary image data records.

The metadata provided in the digital orthophoto contain a wide range of descriptive information including format source information, production instrumentation and dates, and data to assist with displaying and georeferencing the image.

(The following text is partially excerpted from: Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) Program Administrative Handbook,  Draft EWR Divisional Directive 103, Natural Area Registry, MN DNR, Scientific and Natural Areas Program.)<br/><br/>A Natural Area Registry (NAR) Site is a qualifying natural area managed by a government entity (a unit of the federal, state, or local government, (identified as ""Landowner"", or another Division within DNR, identified as ""Primary Administrator"") that is covered by a NAR Agreement by which the site becomes part of the Natural Area Registry.  Sites in this program are managed by various public agencies with management recommendations provided by the Scientific and Natural Areas program and Regional Ecologist.  NARs are established through the use of Natural Area Registry (NAR) Agreements which are non-binding written agreements between the Division of Ecological and Water Resources (EWR) and another governmental entity.  The NAR Agreement identifies the site, explains its significance, describes a proposed management direction, and states that before any management contrary to that direction may occur, the parties who signed the agreement will discuss that proposed management activity.  Note: formerly a ""Memorandum of Understanding"" (MOU) was the vehicle used as the NAR agreement and in many documents, preceding development of this Directive, these terms were used interchangeably.<br/><br/>The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Natural Areas Registry is intended to recognize tracts of public land that contain natural features of statewide ecological significance and possess exceptional scientific or educational value.  NARs recognize the agencies and individuals that manage these lands to protect and perpetuate the features of interest.  Minnesota Statute 86A.05, Subd. 5 states that the Minnesota Scientific and Natural Areas Program was ""established to protect and perpetuate in an undisturbed natural state those natural features which possess exceptional scientific or educational value.""  This Registry acknowledges that many of Minnesota's finest natural areas occur on other public lands that are not designated as SNAs.  Through adoption of ecologically-based management principles and voluntary coordination between the land manager and the SNA Program, Registry sites protect a broader cross section of the state's natural diversity.  <br/>Tracts of public land that contain viable examples of natural features of statewide ecological significance may be identified as NAR candidate sites.  Qualifying sites are selected based upon Landowner/Primary Administrator interest and on the site's ecological quality.  Priority is given to sites that are within MCBS-mapped outstanding and high biodiversity significance sites, are predominantly MCBS-mapped native plant communities, and contain habitat for rare species and Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), or geological features of statewide significance.  Sites nominated for potential NAR registration are reviewed using information compiled in an Ecological Evaluation (EE) or brief written summary of natural features, to determine if the site qualifies for NAR and if protection through NAR is acceptable to all parties.  <br/><br/>The Natural Areas Registry was established in the early 1980s within the DNR Section of Wildlife's Natural Heritage Program, in order to recognize public lands which contain natural features of special interest and to facilitate their protection and perpetuation.  The Registry was modeled after The Nature Conservancy's Private Lands Register, which is no longer in existence.  A number of other states (and international governmental entities) have a Natural Area Registry or Natural Area Register, which may supplement or be in lieu of a system of designated Natural Areas.  In 1986, the administration of the Registry, with 26 NAR sites, was transferred from the Natural Heritage Program to the SNA Program.  Both programs were within the DNR Section of Wildlife at the time.  The first NAR site established was the Soudan Iron Formation at Tower Soudan State Park, February 1982.  From the inception of the Natural Area Registry in 1982 through April 2014, there are 41 sites in the Registry.  Note: through 2011 the NAR has been referred to as both Natural Area Register and Natural Area Registry, with adoption of this directive, the name Natural Area Registry will consistency be used in all future NAR Agreements, and if/when updated, previous agreements will be changed to use this naming convention.<br/><br/>This Representation SNA boundaries is based on the NAR_BASE_DATA feature class in the DNR's core GIS Library. It includes only DEDICATED features, which are dissolved on the following attributes: SITENAME, SITE_ID, BREMCODE. <br/><br/>The coverage should be reasonably accurate although the boundaries probably will not line up with other public land survey information. Some of the boundaries for NAR sites have been created by DNR and other partner staff, and are often sub units within a larger unit.  Since the NAR boundaries have no legal standing, the accuracy of boundaries vary from site to site, but are typically reasonable approximations of the NAR site boundary.",Boundaries,7/24/14,2014-07-29T15:04:46.057707,"{""type"":""Polygon"",""coordinates"":[[[-97.23, 43.5],[-97.23, 49.37], [-89.53, 49.37], [-89.53, 43.5], [-97.23, 43.5]]]}","JPEG, gpkg, fgdb, SHP, HTML",ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_natural_area_registry/metadata/metadata.html,"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_natural_area_registry/preview/preview.jpg, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_natural_area_registry/gpkg_bdry_natural_area_registry.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_natural_area_registry/fgdb_bdry_natural_area_registry.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_natural_area_registry/shp_bdry_natural_area_registry.zip, ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_natural_area_registry/metadata/metadata.html"

Lakes were identified and classified by DNR subject matter experts on objective criteria for four community types (aquatic plants, fish, amphibians, birds). <br/><br/>Unique plant or animal presence was the primary measure of a lake's biological significance. Lakes were rated and grouped for each of the following communities: aquatic plants, fish, birds, and amphibians. Lakes were assigned one of three biological significance classes (<b>outstanding, high, or moderate</b>), which are defined in <i>Section 5: Attributes (below)</i>. Many Minnesota lakes have not been sampled for plants and/or animals, so this list of lakes will be periodically revised as additional biological data become available.<br/><br/>The goal of this list was to identify lakes that exhibit the highest quality features within <u>any of the four assessed biological communities</u> (as opposed to identification of lakes that exhibit diversity across communities). Therefore, a lake needed to meet criteria for only one of the community types (aquatic plants, fish, birds, amphibians) to be identified as a Lake of Biological Significance.

Currently housed at the Office of the Secretary of State, these plats were created by the U.S. Surveyor General's Office. This collection of more than 3,600 maps also includes later General Land Office (GLO) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) maps - up to the year 2001. <br/><br/>Minnesota's survey plat maps serve as the fundamental legal records for real estate in the state; all property titles and descriptions stem from them. They also serve as an essential resource for surveyors and as an analytical tool for the state's physical geography prior to European settlement. Finally, they serve as a testimony to years and years of hard work by the surveying community, often under challenging conditions. <br/><br/>In recent years the deteriorating physical condition of the older maps and the needs of technologically more sophisticated researchers, who require access to the maps, have made handling the original paper records increasingly less practical. To meet this challenge, the Office of the Secretary of State, the State Archives of the Minnesota Historical Society, the Minnesota Department of Transportation, MnGeo (formerly the Land Management Information Center - LMIC) and the Minnesota Association of County Surveyors collaborated in a digitization project which produced images of the maps in standard TIFF, JPEG and PDF formats - nearly 1.5 terabytes worth of data.
