These three variables were combined to create the Priority Score map, which visualizes areas where new public transit connections could be made, changed, or improved to bridge access gaps in the future.",,2017-06-27T15:13:17.062929,HTML,http://dvrpcgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=06eab792a06044f89b5b7fadeef660ba

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Executive Order on Environmental Justice (#12898) do not provide specific guidance to evaluate EJ issues within a region's transportation planning process. Therefore, MPOs must devise their own methods for ensuring that EJ issues are investigated and evaluated in transportation decision-making. In 2001, DVRPC developed an EJ technical assessment to identify direct and disparate impacts of its plans, programs, and planning process on defined population groups in the Delaware Valley region. This assessment, called the Indicators of Potential Disadvantage Methodology, is utilized in a variety of DVRPC plans and programs. 

DVRPC currently assesses the following population groups, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau:

Non-Hispanic Minority, Carless Households, Households in Poverty, Female Head of Household with Child, Elderly (over 75 years), Hispanic, Limited English, Proficiency, Persons with Disabilities

Process Steps for Calculating Building Height Statistics:

Normalized digital surface models (nDSM) and slope rasters were generated from 0.5-meter LiDAR data.

Geodesic area was calculated (in square feet) for all features classified as ‘Building’.

A negative 1 meter buffer was applied to all building features with an area greater than 200 square meters - applied in an effort to ensure nDSM input values were those corresponding to the building roof and not the adjacent ground.

Zonal statistics (Spatial Analyst extension) were calculated on the buffered features for each nDSM raster (first multiplying each raster by 10 to maintain precision and then converting from floating point to integer raster) and slope raster (generated from each integerized nDSM raster). Zonal percentile statistics were also calculated on buffered features for each raster to obtain the 90th percentile building heights (HEIGHT_ESTIMATE field).

All output statistics fields were joined to the original input feature class (with unit conversions applied, where necessary).

When snow accumulations approach emergency status, the Managing Director may declare a snow emergency. Once emergency status is declared, the City's 110 miles of Snow Emergency Routes receive priority. Owners of vehicles and dumpsters must move them to alternate parking spaces so City forces can clear snow from curb-to-curb on the emergency routes. Any vehicle remaining on a Snow Emergency Route during the declared Snow Emergency will be ticketed and towed. If your car is towed, call 215-686-SNOW for its location. Do NOT call 911.
The snow-emergency-routes.csv file was created from the table on the Streets Department snow emergency route page. I used this file to generate the snow-emergency-route-segment-ids.csv file.

The snow-emergency-route-segment-ids.csv file contains the IDs of all of the street segments that are classified as snow emergency routes. The snow emergency routes shapefile/geojson is built by filtering the street centerline layer to include only those rows where the seg_id is contained in this list.

The Philadelphia Healthy Chinese Take-out Initiative is working to prevent and control high blood pressure in Philadelphia residents by 1) reducing the sodium content in Chinese take-out dishes by 10-15% and 2) decreasing access to tobacco products. The initiative is a joint effort among Temple University’s Center for Asian Health, the Asian Community Health Coalition, the Philadelphia Chinese Restaurant Association, and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Excess consumption of sodium (salt) and tobacco use are two major contributors to hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Chinese take-out restaurant dishes can have large amounts of sodium mainly due to the sauces used in preparation and cooking. And Chinese take-out restaurants tend to have higher rates of illegal tobacco sales to minors than other retailers. To date, 200 Chinese take-out restaurants have enrolled in the initiative, participated in a low-sodium healthy cooking training with a professional chef, and received education about complying with the Tobacco Youth Sales Law.

The Delaware Valley is a premier freight transportation gateway. It possesses one of the world's busiest freshwater ports; rail freight service from two large Class I railroads and 12 smaller short lines; an airport with expanding international cargo services; an excellent highway and connector network; and numerous rail and port intermodal terminals.

The performance of this extraordinary network helps promote and support a thriving economy. PhillyFreightFinder is a resource for exploring and tracking the Philadelphia-Camden-Trenton regional freight network.

Open Freight App is a project by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) to share with regional and national transportation planning partners the framework that is the basis for the PhillyFreightFinder web mapping and data application. Through this effort, DVRPC hopes that county planning agencies, metropolitan planning organizations and state departments of transportation, and economic development agencies can leverage this framework to further their efforts in making freight transportation data public. By utilizing the Open Freight App framework, rather than building from scratch, planning agencies can focus their time and resources on the development of data sets that can serve to improve the access to information on freight facilities and their role in economic development and transportation across the country. Open Freight App would serve as a self-hosted solution to offer these datasets to other planners, economic developers, public officials, decision-makers and the general public.",Transportation,2016-08-15T17:19:42.213814,HTML,http://dvrpc.org/webmaps/PhillyFreightFinder/

Delaware Valley Data is our periodic series of free data bulletins, data snapshots, and analytical data reports. This analytical data report provides revised 2040 and interim-year population and employment forecasts for the DVRPC region’s counties and municipalities. DVRPC prepared these forecasts in order to incorporate the results of the 2010 Census, account for the ongoing economic recession, and maintain a 30-year planning horizon. 2040 population forecasts were originally adopted by the DVRPC Board on January 26, 2012 and published in April 2012 in Analytical Data Report 18. On February 28, 2013, the DVRPC Board amended the 2040 and interim year population forecasts for Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to account for a significant residential development that was unforeseen when the 2040 population forecasts were adopted in January 2012. This amendment resulted in corresponding revisions to the population forecasts for Montgomery County and the DVRPC region as a whole. This amended analytical data report includes these revisions. This report also consolidates the adopted population forecasts for Princeton Township and Princeton Borough in Mercer County, New Jersey, which merged and became one municipality known simply as Princeton on January 1, 2013. Additionally, inconsistencies in some summary totals in ADR 18 caused by rounding were also corrected. The adopted population forecasts provided in this report will serve as the basis for DVRPC’s planning and modeling activities, along with the 2040 employment forecasts that were prepared and adopted in September 2012.  NETS database for 2010 was used for employment data.  http://www.dvrpc.org/asp/pubs/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=ADR019 http://www.dvrpc.org/asp/pubs/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=ADR018-A Source of geographic boundaries: DVRPC","Budget / Finance, Health / Human Services",2016-08-12T18:32:32.444798,"api, geojson, CSV, shp","http://arcgis.dvrpc.org/arcgis/rest/services/Demographics/PopEmpForecastMCD/FeatureServer/0, http://dvrpc.dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0.geojson, http://dvrpc.dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0.csv, http://dvrpc.dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1e3beb6aa144f2b8dd07693567077cc_0.zip"

More information on sources is available at http://www.policymap.com/files/ChildcareMapDataDirectory.pdf.

Data Purpose:  TRF collected the data to provide as clear a picture as possible of the supply of and demand for childcare in the city, and to better understand where the gaps are so that stakeholders can work to address them.
Intended Audience:  Childcare providers, investors, policy makers, and parents.
Why Collected:  High-quality childcare supports positive child development and prepares children for success in school and beyond.  As such, accessing high-quality care is important for the well-being of neighborhoods and families.

<br><br>
<ol style=""list-style: decimal inside none;"">
<li>
Stops with service provided by only one route, stop is not the first or last stop and
all travel is in a single direction:

<br>
Returns the next 4 scheduled trolleys (All Route 13) at Chester Ave & 49th St.
<br><br>
</li><li>
Stops with service provided by multiple routes, but all travel is in one direction:
<br><br>
http://www3.septa.org/sms/20645/
<br>
Returns the next 4 scheduled trolleys at 22nd St. Station. Note the results shows
trolleys regardless or route.  To grep just a single route, for a multi-route, uni-directional
stop, add another var:
<br><br>
http://www3.septa.org/sms/20645/13/
<br>
Returns only the Route 13 trolleys at 22nd St. Station
<br><br>
</li><li>
Stops with travel in multi-directions.  This is usually end points, like the trolley
loop at Juniper and they may or may not have multiple routes.  For example:

<br>
Returns the next 2 inbound and 2 outbound times for all routes

In recent decades, as congregations face declining membership and shifting neighborhood demographics, these historically- and architecturally-significant properties have often suffered from deferred maintenance, insensitive alterations, and partial or complete demolition.

Advocacy organizations like the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and Partners for Sacred Places have focused on this issue for years, highlighting the threats to Philadelphia's neighborhoods and communities if these structures continue to be abandoned or lost. Over the summer of 2011, in order to more fully understand and address the issue, the Preservation Alliance partnered with Philadelphia Historical Commission and Partners for Sacred Places to develop a comprehensive index of historic churches covering the entire city. Compiling, verifying, and updating data from a number of different sources, University of Pennsylvania graduate student Molly Lester assembled a database which includes every purpose-built house of worship constructed in the city before 1960.

Data elements include:  current congregation, original congregation, address, year of construction, original architect and whether or not the build is on the Philadelphia or National Historic Registers.
